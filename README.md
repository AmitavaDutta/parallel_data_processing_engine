# Parallel Data Processing Engine

## Project Description

This repository contains a high-performance benchmarking suite designed to evaluate and compare data processing efficiency across CPU (Serial, Parallel, Block-wise) and GPU architectures. Using correlation matrix estimation from large collections of time series as a case study, the project systematically analyzes $O(N^2)$ complexity bottlenecks. The primary objective is to identify the break-even points where hardware computational gains successfully outweigh data serialization and memory transfer overheads as data dimensionality scales.

The testing encompasses both synthetic random data and real-world empirical datasets—specifically NASA POWER temperature data and financial time series—to ensure robust performance analysis under varying spatial and temporal constraints.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into distinct functional domains, separating the unified benchmarking engine from specialized exploratory analyses and validation suites.

## Execution Guide

The engine provides a unified Command Line Interface (CLI) via `run_experiment.py` for executing standard benchmarks. If no dataset is explicitly passed, the engine defaults to generating a synthetic random dataset ($N \times T$) for baseline testing.

---

### CPU Benchmarks

To execute CPU experiments, specify the algorithm `--version` (`baseline` or `optimized`) and the `--blas` threading backend (`single` or `multi`).

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
python run_experiment.py --mode cpu --version <baseline|optimized> --blas <single|multi>
```

**Using Real-World Dataset:**
```bash
python run_experiment.py --mode cpu --version optimized --blas multi --dataset real --data_path src/data/global_temp_use.csv --data_id global_temp
```

---

### GPU Benchmarks

GPU execution follows an identical interface. Note that BLAS threading control is not required as it is natively managed by the CUDA backend.

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
python run_experiment.py --mode gpu --version <baseline|optimized>
```

**Using Real-World Dataset:**
```bash
python run_experiment.py --mode gpu --version optimized --dataset real --data_path src/data/global_temp_use.csv --data_id global_temp
```

---

## Hardware Detection & Safety

- **CUDA Detection:** The engine automatically scans for available CUDA-compatible hardware. Upon success, the system initializes the GPU device:
  
  ```
  [Device] CUDA-compatible GPU detected.
  ```

- **Graceful Exit:** In environments where a GPU is requested but not detected, the program terminates safely without data loss.

---

## Data Management & Output

### Dataset Specifications

- Initial benchmarking is conducted using synthetic matrices to establish theoretical complexity bounds.
- For empirical validation, the engine utilizes structured real datasets.

**Format:**
- Input matrices follow an **N × T** structure  
  - **N** = number of locations  
  - **T** = number of time steps  

**Validation:**
- Ensures numerical consistency and performance stability on structured datasets.

---

### Output Hierarchy

All experimental results—including runtime CSV logs, memory profiles, and correlation outputs—are automatically routed to the `results/` directory using a hierarchical structure:

```text
results/
├── cpu/
│   └── <version>/<dataset_id>/...
└── gpu/
    └── <version>/<dataset_id>/...
```

**Example Output Path:**
```
results/gpu/optimized/global_temp/results_global_temp_optimized_gpu.csv
```

### Testing the implementation on an actual dataset
The initial benchmarking was performed on randomly generated dataset. We will use temperature data over a decade from a large number of locations (N) obtained from NASA POWER API. This is to ensure that the implementation works on actual datasets too.
